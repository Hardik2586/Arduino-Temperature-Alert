# Arduino-Temperature-Alert
Designed a microcontroller-based system using Arduino to monitor temperature and generate multi-stage alerts. The project includes threshold-based activation of LEDs and variable buzzer tones depending on the temperature range. This project strengthened my skills in embedded C programming, analog sensor interfacing, and digital control logic.
